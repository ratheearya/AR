            Hello! My name is Arya Rathee and I am a software engineer who specialized in backend development. 
            I am currently 18 years old. Some hobbies of mine include playing sports (tennis, basketball, and any sport really), 
            hiking and finding nice views, and of course eating üòÅ. I was born in India but moved to and currently live in the bay area.
            (This website is also currently in development!)
        </p>

        <p style="display:inline-block ; padding-right: 20%; vertical-align: top; width: 15%;"> Instant Messaging App</p>
        <p> Using web sockets, I created a chat application that could be used to broadcast messages to anyone connected to the webpage.
            The frontend of the webpage is built with html, css, and jquery/javascript. The backed was built with Flask. 
            I am currently working on adding a firebase user authentication system. </p>

        <p style="display:inline-block ; padding-right: 20%; vertical-align: top;width: 15%;"> Sudoku Solver</p>
        <p> While it may be simple, I must add one of my favorite projects that got me interested in computer science in the first place. An automatic sudoku solver.
            Built on Flask, I used a backtracking algorithm to solve any given sudoku puzzle, assuming that there is a guarenteed solution. This project was very exciting and fascinating to build, and got me into computer science in the first place
        Technology can really do some amazing things! </p>

        <p style="display:inline-block ; padding-right: 20%; vertical-align: top;width: 15%"> Coming Soon: Expired </p>
         <p> As a college student currently living alone in a house, I started to realize how quickly fresh foods go bad if you don't eat them. I've noticed myself wasting a lot of uneaten food because they have gone bad.
            Therefore I am going to build an app that will track all of my food and their expiry dates, and add reminders so that I make sure none of the food goes to waste! The app will be built on swift since I use a lot of ios products. </p>
